Disadvantage of Recursion: Note that both recursive and iterative programs have the same problem-solving powers, i.e., every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa. Recursive program has greater space requirements than iterative program as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. A recursive program also has greater time requirements because of function calls and return overhead.

 Advantages of Recursion: Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive like tree traversals, Tower of Hanoi, etc. For such problems, it is preferred to write recursive code. We can write such codes also iteratively with the help of the stack data structure.
